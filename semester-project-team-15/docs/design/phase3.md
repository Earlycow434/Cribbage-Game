# Team Management Style

We meet three times throughout the project and primarily used Githubâ€™s integrated project
management suite to organize the deliverables into sub tasks assigned to team members.
In order to better utilize these tools, we instilled the use of PlantUML to allow for a codified,
reviewable format that would benefit from the PR infrastructure in Github.

## Meeting 1 (10/16/22)
We briefly discussed the scope of phase 3 while scoping out the tasks necessary to complete to
achieve the deliverables. We agreed to read through the peer review of our domain model and began scoping out the classes we would need to eventually implement for the cribbage game.

## Meeting 2 (10/19/22)
Creation of tasks by the team leader commenced and we revised the individual domain model. Additionally, we finalized the fundamental classes needed for our system model and began to plan for the major sequences of operation.

## Meeting 3 (10/20/22)
We completed implementation of the fundamental classes and completed the required sequence diagrams. We finished with code review and prepared for submission.
